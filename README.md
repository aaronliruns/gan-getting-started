## Cyclegan Add Monet Flavor  


Artists like Claude Monet can be imitated with algorithms thanks to generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this mini project, we will bring that style to the photos taken from camera.

The dataset contains four directories: monet_tfrec, photo_tfrec, monet_jpg, and photo_jpg. The monet_tfrec and monet_jpg directories contain the same painting images, and the photo_tfrec and photo_jpg directories contain the same photos.

We will use TFRecords to deserialize the Monet images as well as the camera photos from tfrec files where Monet images will be used to train the model. As the outcome of the project, we will add Monet-style to these images so that the camera taken photos will have a flavor of Monet. A zip file containing 10,000 immages will eventually produced for final submission.
